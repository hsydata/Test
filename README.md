### Exploratory Data Analysis 
XXX involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

### Recommendations 
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions: 
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximise revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy the target high LTV customers effectively.

  
### Limitations 
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns becausethey would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and the number of votes with revenue.
